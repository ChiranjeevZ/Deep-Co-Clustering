# Deep-Co-Clustering

This is a reference implemenmtation for Deep Co-Clustering (SDM'19). Please feel free to contact Dongkuan Xu (dux19@psu.edu) if you have any question.

# Main function
The main file is: main_coil20.py. It is for the Coil20 dataset.

It is easy to run DeepCC on other datasets by changing the data_path in main_coil20.py (Line 13).

Please change the input dimensions of autoencoders correspondingly when run it for other datasets (Line 19, 21).
