# Deep-Co-Clustering
=============================================
Code and data of Deep Co-Clustering (SDM'19)

Our proposed approach, DeepCC, is the 1st deep neural network-based model for the co-clustering task.

1. The main file is: main_coil20.py
1.1. main_coil20.py is for the Coil20 dataset
1.2. it is easy to run DeepCC on other datasets by changing the data_path in main_coil20.py
1.3. Another important file is: core/paegmm/kddcup10/kddcup10_pae_gmm.py. This file contains the main body of DeepCC (including the hyperparameter setting).

2. The main file is: main_
