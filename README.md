# Deep-Co-Clustering
Code and data for Deep Co-Clustering (SDM'19)
=============================================

1. The main file is: main_coil20.py

2. The program is for the Coil20 dataset; it is easy to run DeepCC on other datasets by changing the data_path in main_coil20.py

3. Another important file is: core/paegmm/kddcup10/kddcup10_pae_gmm.py. This file contains the main body of DeepCC (including the hyperparameter setting).
